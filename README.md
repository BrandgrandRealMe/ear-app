# Electron PWA Wrapper

A sample wrapper app to package your Progressive Web App into a Desktop Application using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

Drafted for the future Desktop-version of my [Leasing Calculator](https://www.leasingrechnen.at) Web App using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [Materialize.css](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) and a lot of Offline-First love over at [leasingrechnen.at](https://www.leasingrechnen.at).

### Early development stage, please don't use for your projects yet.

## Upcoming Features
- loading animation window for first boot
- handle connectivity issues natively in the wrapper

## Wanna give it a try?
- clone repository, *cd* into the directory
- run `npm install` to get the dependencies
- run `npm run electron` to start the app
- check out */app/constants.js* for some options (e.g. setting your own URL)
